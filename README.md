# TICKET CLASSIFIER
This project aims to develop a model which takes tickets raised by customers in a banking platform as input and classify them into different classes for better routing experience.
## Objectives:
* Data Preprocessing: Utilized python libraries- Numpy, Pandas, NLTK and SpaCy for data cleaning and preprocessing.
* EDA: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis by making use of python visualization library- Matplotlib.
* Data Labelling : Each datapoint of the dataset is labelled by using the concept of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization.
* Model Building and Fine Tuning: Employed various models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with GridSearchCV for classification and achieved an accuracy of 97% on Logistic Regression.
## Tech Stack/Frameworks:
* Frontend: HTML, CSS
* Backend: Flask
* Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, SpaCy
